<details><summary>Click here to view instructions</summary>

#### Main Menu
The main menu showcases an ASCII art representation of the title 'Black Jack'. Beneath the welcoming graphic, users are given two choices:

1. Read game manual.
2. Start a game.

To access the game rules, user may input "0". For gameplay, any other key can be pressed.

#### Game rules

Rules of the game are:

    1) Player and Casino receives two random cards from the followoing array: unlimitted_deck = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11]
    2) Player can see both his cards and only one card of the casino
    3) If at some point of the game the sum of the cards is over 21 casino/player who have the cards loses straight away
    4) If at some point of the game, the sum of the card is 21, casino/player who have the cards wins straight away.
    5) If sum of the cards is bellow 21 for both players and noone wants to take additional card, we compaire sum of player and casino cards to define a winner.

    6) After receiving two cards the player may choose to receive additional card.
    7) If player do not want to take additional card, casino check if Casino SUM > Player SUM and if Casino SUM 17. If it is the case, casino takes additional card.  If the above statement is not true, casino does not take any additional card.

#### Game

When the user click "RUN Program"
He is welcomed to the game. The game informs him that he is going to play a game of 10 rounds. Website informs him that results of the game will be saved to Excel.

After the user has an option to press 0 to see game manual,  or to press any other key to start a game.

When the game starts the user receives 2 cards and see both of them. Casino also receives two cards but player can see only 1 of them.


After user has an option to take an additional card. If player receive an additional card we have three outcomes
1. Player SUm  > 21. In this situation the player loses
2. Player sum = 21. Player wins
3. Player Sum <21 in this case player may take additional card. If player does not take additional card the casino starts playing.

After the user rejects to take a new card the casino starts playing. Casino Checks if casino sum > player sum. In this is the case, casino wins.

If Casino SUM <= Player SUM and Casino Sum < 17 the casino takes additional cards.
in this senario we have the following outomes:
1. Casino Sum > 21. In this scenario casino loses the game.
2. Casino Sum = 21. In this scenario casino wins.
3. If casino Sum > player sum casino wins
4. If casino Sum <= Player Sum  and Casino Sum > 17. We compaire the sums of Casino and Player
to define a winner.
5. If casino Sum <= Player Sum  and Casino Sum < 17. Casino takes a new card and we check again if statements from 1-5 are true. Finaly the casino wins or loses the game according to the if statements above



#### End of a Game 
At the end of the game the user has an option to play a game again.

Here is an output the user is going to see:

- [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) was used as a python code checker.
- [heroku Platform](https://www.heroku.com//) was user to deploy a game to live website.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
VSCode was used to write the project code using Code Institute template

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries
- random - used to assign two random cards from the deck to casino and player
- time - used to displayed delayed messages in the terminal

### Automated Testing
<details><summary>See unit testing</summary>

- I wrote unit tests using Python unittest library
- I tested separate functions to verify correct user input:
  - validation of user email and user name input

I needed to amend the function and add 'Try Except' blocks to handle TypeError.
Initial error called - 'TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()'


![User email unit test](docs/testing/unit-tests/email-validation-test.jpg)
![User name unit test](docs/testing/unit-tests/username-validation-test.jpg)

  - validation of data in log_in_players and register_new_players

When running the test initially, there was a TypeError called - 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable'. I handled this error by adding 'Try Except' blocks to both functions. This resulted with passed test.
