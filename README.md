## About

I created a command-line version of the casino game Blackjack.

The game's participants are the Casino and the Player. Each game consists of 10 rounds. The winner of each round is determined by simplified Blackjack rules.

I used the Google API to save the results of the rounds to a worksheet. Additionally, I retrieve the round results with the Google API from the worksheet to estimate the probability of a Player Win, Loss, or Draw

### User Manual

<details><summary>Click here to view instructions</summary>

#### Main Menu
The main menu showcases an ASCII art representation of the title 'Black Jack'. Beneath the welcoming graphic, users are given two choices:

1. Read game manual.
2. Start a game.

To access the game rules, user may input "0". For gameplay, any other key can be pressed.

#### Game rules

Rules of the game are:

1) Player and Casino receive two random cards from the following array: unlimited_deck = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11].
2) The player can see both their cards and only one card of the casino.
3) If at some point in the game the sum of the cards is over 21, the casino/player who has the cards loses straight away.
4) If at some point in the game, the sum of the cards is 21, the casino/player who has the cards wins straight away.
5) If the sum of the cards is below 21 for both players and neither wants to take an additional card, we compare the sum of the player and casino cards to define a winner.
6) After receiving two cards, the player may choose to receive an additional card.
7) If the player does not want to take an additional card, the casino checks if the casino's sum > the player's sum and if the casino's sum is 17. If this is the case, the casino takes an additional card. If the above statement is not true, the casino does not take any additional card.
8) The casino wins the game when the "casino sum" > "player sum" or when the casino sum = 21. The player wins the game if at the end of a round, the "player sum" > "casino sum".

#### Game

When the user clicks "RUN Program," they are welcomed to the game. The game informs them that they are going to play a game of 10 rounds. The website informs them that the results of the game will be saved to Excel.

Afterward, the user has the option to press 0 to see the game manual or press any other key to start the game.

Once the game starts, the user receives 2 cards and can see both of them. The casino also receives two cards, but the player can only see 1 of them.

After user has an option to take an additional card. If player receive an additional card we have three outcomes
1. Player SUm  > 21. In this situation the player loses
2. Player sum = 21. Player wins
3. Player Sum <21 in this case player may take additional card. If player does not take additional card the casino starts playing.

After the user rejects to take a new card the casino starts playing. Casino Checks if "casino sum" > "player sum". In this is the case, casino wins.

If Casino SUM <= Player SUM and Casino Sum < 17 the casino takes additional cards.
in this senario we have the following outomes:
1. Casino Sum > 21. In this scenario casino loses the game.
2. Casino Sum = 21. In this scenario casino wins.
3. If casino Sum > player sum casino wins
4. If casino Sum <= Player Sum  and Casino Sum > 17. We compaire the sums of Casino and Player
to define a winner.
5. If casino Sum <= Player Sum  and Casino Sum < 17. Casino takes a new card and we check again if statements from 1-5 are true. Finaly the casino wins or loses the game according to the if statements above



#### End of a Game 
At the end of the game the user has an option to play a game again.

Here is an output the user is going to see:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
After 10 rounds the score is 
PLAYER:8 CASINO:2
Player won a game of 10 rounds
PRESS ANY KEY TO PLAY. PRESS 0 TO SEE GAME STATS:


#### Go to main menu
At the end of the game the user haas an option to restart the game.
To restart it he need to press any key exepct "0" After that the user
see game's default menue.

#### See your statistics
At the end of the game the user has an option to see statistics of the game.

He will see a message: 
    "PRESS ANY KEY TO PLAY. PRESS 0 TO SEE GAME STATS"
If the user press 0 he will see an output in the following format:
    The stats are: 
    PLAYER'S PROPABILITY TO WIN :40.0%
    CASINO'S PROPABILITY TO WIN:58.75%
    THE PROBABILITY FOR A DRAW IS: 1.25%

## Technical Design

### Flowchart

Because of complicated sturcture, I devided application chart in two charts.
The first chart shows the flow of a Round.
The second chart has a game chart with while loops. I added Round Flow Chart to it as a rectangle.

</details>

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Frameworks & Tools

- [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) was used for flowchart creation.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control to push changes from gitpod to github
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store a code.
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console/) It was utilized to handle access and permissions for various Google Services, including Google authentication, Google Sheets, and others.
- [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) were used to store game logs and game's statistics
- [PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used as a python code checker.
- [heroku Platform](https://www.heroku.com//) was user to deploy a game to live website.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
VSCode was used to write the project code using Code Institute template

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries
- random - used to assign two random cards from the deck to casino and player
- time - used to displayed delayed messages in the terminal
- date - was user to record date and time of the log line, which is saved in Excel

#### Third Party Libraries
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) - Was used to make the text of the game more readable and experience more enjoyable.
- [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) - I utilized the gspread library to perform tasks such as adding and manipulating data within my Google spreadsheet.
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - The module employed to establish the necessary authentication for accessing the Google API and linking my Service Account with the Credentials function is responsible for this setup. As a result, a creds.json file is generated, containing all the required details for the API to access the associated Google account. During deployment to Render, this information is stored within the config var section.
